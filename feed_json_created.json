Highlighting key differences in approach, implementation, and alternative services provided by the Foundation.</p>\n<p>We will cover the following topics in the next blog posts:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>CI pipelines (GitHub Workflows, GitLab Runners)</li>\n<li>Runner management and execution environments</li>\n<li>Quota models and build resource allocation</li>\n<li>Additional build-related services</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"what-this-blog-post-series-will-not-cover\">What This Blog Post Series Will not Cover</h2>\n<p>To keep things focused and digestible, we won\u2019t be covering broader topics such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Project visibility/SEO</li>\n<li>Data sovereignty and compliance</li>\n<li>Community engagement and contribution models</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While these are critical considerations when selecting a platform, they deserve their own dedicated posts.</p>\n<p>Before we jump into the details, it\u2019s important to note that the versions of GitHub and GitLab offered by the Eclipse Foundation are enterprise-grade:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>GitHub Enterprise</li>\n<li>GitLab Ultimate</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This is crucial because these versions unlock advanced features, such as extended security options; extra build times, that are not available in the public/community versions.</p>\n<h2 id=\"github-actions-gitlab-ci-and-jenkins\">GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, and Jenkins</h2>\n<p>GitHub Actions and GitLab CI are very similar in structure, syntax, and functionality:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In both cases, CI/CD configuration files are written in YAML and stored closed to the code in the Git repository.</li>\n<li>Both are event-driven and get triggered by pushes, PR/MR, tags, issues, or on a schedule.</li>\n<li>Tasks can be defined in stages (e.g. build, test, publish, deploy).</li>\n<li>Both allow templating or re-use of tasks.</li>\n<li>Both feature plenty of integrations (via the <a href=\"https://github.com/marketplace\">GitHub Marketplace</a> or <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/guided-explorations/ci-cd-plugin-extensions\">GitLab CI extensions</a>).\nWhile the GitHub Marketplace has more actions, GitLab has built-in security and governance checks.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>At the end of the day, it\u2019s a matter of preference. For most common CI tasks, both systems are equally easy to write, maintain, and execute.\nImplementing specific use-cases can require more in-depth knowledge and might have a steep learning curve. </p>\n<p>The Eclipse Foundation also offers a fully managed <a href=\"https://ci.eclipse.org\">Jenkins instance for every project</a>. It easily integrates with either GitHub or GitLab and provides an additional CI/CD approach.\nJenkins can be used instead of GitHub actions or GitLab CI, but also in combination with each respective system. Due to its <a href=\"https://plugins.jenkins.io/\">plugin-based structure</a>, many scenarios can be covered.</p>\n<h2 id=\"who-manages-the-runners\">Who Manages the Runners?</h2>\n<p>GitLab CI relies on dedicated runners, deployed and managed by the Eclipse Foundation Releng team. Runners are provisioned with <a href=\"https://gitlab.eclipse.org/eclipsefdn/it/releng/gitlab-runner-service/gitlab-runner-as-code\">GRaC (GitLab Runner as Code)</a>\nand all requests for GitLab CI require a <a href=\"https://gitlab.eclipse.org/eclipsefdn/helpdesk/-/issues/new\">Helpdesk ticket</a> so that the Releng team can provision and configure runners.</p>\n<p>Standard GitHub runners offered to public projects for free do not require maintenance from the Releng team.\n<a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/using-larger-runners/about-larger-runners\">Larger and more powerful GitHub runners</a> can be set up on demand with sponsoring from eligible Eclipse member organizations.</p>\n<h2 id=\"where-are-my-builds-running\">Where Are My Builds Running?</h2>\n<p>The Eclipse Foundation\u2019s build infrastructure is running on an OKD Kubernetes cluster (the upstream community project of OpenShift) on-premises.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/eclipse-cbi/cbi/wiki#gitlab-runners\">GitLab CI/CD runners</a> and Jenkins builds are executed within the Eclipse Foundation\u2019s build cluster, located in Canada.\nGitHub Actions runners, run on GitHub\u2019s cloud infrastructure.</p>\n<p>The infrastructure where the runners are executed is essential because, as we will see later, it can have security implications depending on the measures implemented within these environments.</p>\n<h2 id=\"external-runners\">External Runners</h2>\n<p>Projects can ask to connect  their own runners when they need:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Higher performance (more CPU/RAM) than default runner configuration can provide</li>\n<li>Custom execution environments: RISC-V, ARM, ...</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This requires a <a href=\"https://gitlab.eclipse.org/eclipsefdn/helpdesk/-/issues/new\">Helpdesk ticket</a> and approval from the Eclipse Foundation security team.</p>\n<h2 id=\"next-posts\">Next posts</h2>\n<p>That wraps up this first article!

The CBI blog is an important part of this objective and should give our community more insight into what has happened and what will happen in the future in \u201creleng land\u201d. It will involve a good amount of \u201clearning on the job\u201d and we will adjust content and technical details as we see fit.</p>\n<p>The current plan is to have:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>One blog post per month (schedule: TBD)</li>\n<li>Topics: status updates, road map insights, best practices, technical details</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"cbi-in-general\">CBI in general</h2>\n<p>Our three main objectives for 2025 are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>More monitoring</li>\n<li>Modernizing releng services</li>\n<li>Enhance communication</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We already mentioned enhanced communication above, and you are currently reading one of the results. Another step stone for better communication is a central page for CBI related topics that should make it a lot easier for everyone to find information and documentation that is distributed across multiple locations.
