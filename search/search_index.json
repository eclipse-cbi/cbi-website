The resources assigned to this \"jnlp\" container come from a default values we set for you. Because we know the \"jnlp\" container does not use need of CPU and memory, we set the default values for all containers to low values (about 512\u00a0MiB and 0.25 vCPU). This way, we're sure that the \"jnlp\" container won't uselessly consume too many resources that are allocated to your project. But this has the negative effect that, if you don't effectively specify the resources requests and limits in your pod template, your custom containers will also inherit those values (which are probably too low for you). To overcome the issue, you need to specify those values in your pod template like:</p> <pre><code>pipeline {\n  agent {\n    kubernetes {\n      label 'my-agent-pod'\n      yaml \"\"\"\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Pod\nspec:\n  containers:\n  - name: maven\n    image: maven:alpine\n    command:\n    - cat\n    tty: true\n    resources:\n      limits:\n        memory: \"2Gi\"\n        cpu: \"1\"\n      requests:\n        memory: \"2Gi\"\n        cpu: \"1\"\n\"\"\"\n    }\n  }\n  stages {\n    stage('Run maven') {\n      steps {\n        container('maven') {\n          sh 'mvn -version'\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Note that if you run multiple containers, you need to specify the limits for each. </p> <p>We plan to develop some tooling to automatically inject correct default values for your custom containers depending on the resource quotas and the concurrency level (i.e. how many agents can run at once) assigned to your project GitHub Issue #20.</p>"},{"location":"jiro/Common-build-errors/#my-build-fails-with-fatal-cannot-run-program-xvnc-what-do-i-need-to-do","title":"My build fails with: 'FATAL: Cannot run program \"Xvnc\"', what do I need to do?","text":"<p>You are most likely running UI tests that require a desktop environment and a VNC server.

There are 2 kinds of agents: dynamic and static. Dynamic agents are created on-demand when a build job require one. All agents on the clustered infrastructure are dynamic. Both dynamic and static agents can exist on the same master. </li> <li>An executor is a slot for executing a build job defined by a pipeline or a job on an agent. An agent may have zero or more executors configured, which corresponds to how many concurrent projects or pipelines are able to execute on that agent. All dynamic agents in the cluster have a single executor. Note that Jenkins masters can also have executors, but this is considered a bad practice for a long time, and masters have no executors in the clustered infrastructure.</li> </ul> <p>By default, all Eclipse projects run with a master able to dynamically create 2 agents in the cluster at the same time.

The agent is scheduled on a physical node by Kubernetes (See Kubernetes compute resource management documentation for details). In general, Kubernetes tries to allocate agents on the least busy node. Once an agent is created on a node, it won't move until the end of the build. During the build, if there are some spare CPU cycles (i.e. cycles that have not been reserved by others) on the node, the agent will get more CPU up to the burst limit. So, while projects don't compete with each other for the requested vCPU, they compete for the CPU burst. Note that the burst should be shared fairly between projects.

A: To target a specific runner for your job, you can use runner tags. Runner tags are labels assigned to runners that help you select the right runner for specific jobs. Each Eclipse foundation GitLab runner comes with a set of default labels.  I.e:  * <code>prefix:ef-grac</code>  * <code>cluster:okd-c1</code>  * <code>type:groups</code>  * <code>instance:technologie.cbi.grac</code> * <code>ctx:medium</code>  * <code>executor:kubernetes</code>  * <code>kubenamespace:ef-grac-technologie-cbi-grac</code> * <code>concurrent:8</code>  * <code>outputLimit:100000</code>  * <code>image:ubuntu:20.04</code>  * <code>cpuLimit:8000</code>  * <code>cpuRequest:1000</code>  * <code>memoryLimit:16384</code>  * <code>memoryRequest:2048</code>  * <code>serviceCpuLimit:8000</code>  * <code>origin:eclipse</code></p> <p>Q: How do I assign extra tags to runners?</p> <p>A: Tags can be assigned to runners during runner registration, e.g: my-tag, java, docker, etc., based on the capabilities or characteristics of the runner. This can be requested at any time, at runner creation or later by simply filling out a request in the helpdesk support.</p> <p>NOTE: by default, runners are set up to run untagged jobs.</p> <p>Q: How do I use runner tags in my CI/CD job configuration?</p> <p>A: In your <code>.gitlab-ci.yml</code> file, you can use the <code>tags</code> keyword at the top-level description for pipeline definition or in the job configuration to specify the runner tags that the pipeline or the job should target.</p> <p>At pipeline level:</p> <pre><code>default:\n  tags:\n    - origin:eclipse\n</code></pre> <p>At job level: </p> <pre><code>my_job:\n  tags:\n    - origin:eclipse\n  script:\n    - echo \"Running on a Eclipse foundation runner\"\n</code></pre> <p>Q: How do I choose the type of runner in a job?</p> <pre><code>my_job:\n  tags:\n    - ctx:medium\n  script:\n    - echo \"Running on a Eclipse foundation runner of medium type\"\n</code></pre> <p>Q: What if no runner matches the specified tags?</p> <p>A: If no runner matches the specified tags, the job won't run. Make sure that your runner tags correspond to the capabilities of your runners and the requirements of your jobs.</p> <p>Q: Is there a default runner if no tags are specified?</p> <p>A: GitLab CI will automatically select a runner that doesn't have any tags assigned if you don't specify tags for a job.

The mission of the Mylyn project is to provide: 1. Frameworks and APIs for Eclipse-based task and Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) 2. Exemplary tools for task-focused programming within the Eclipse IDE. 3. Reference implementations for open source ALM tools used by the Eclipse community and for open ALM standards such as OSLC The project is structured into sub-projects, each representing an ALM category and providing common APIs for specific ALM tools. The primary consumers of this project are ALM ISVs and other adopters of Eclipse ALM frameworks.  Please see the project charter for more details. Mylyn makes tasks a first class part of Eclipse, and integrates rich and offline editing for repositories such as Bugzilla, Trac, and JIRA. Once your tasks are integrated, Mylyn monitors your work activity to identify information relevant to the task-at-hand, and uses this task context to focus the Eclipse UI on the interesting information, hide the uninteresting, and automatically find what's related. This puts the information you need to get work done at your fingertips and improves productivity by reducing searching, scrolling, and navigation. By making task context explicit Mylyn also facilitates multitasking, planning, reusing past efforts, and sharing expertise.</p>"},{"location":"chat-service-documentation/content/rooms/_index/#eclipse-newcomers-room-badge-prefixpeople-text857","title":"Eclipse Newcomers Room {{&lt; badge prefix=\"people\" text=\"857\" &gt;}}","text":"<p>#eclipse-newcomers:matrix.eclipse.org</p> <p>Welcome to the Eclipse Newcomers Room!

The mission of the Mylyn project is to provide: 1. Frameworks and APIs for Eclipse-based task and Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) 2. Exemplary tools for task-focused programming within the Eclipse IDE. 3. Reference implementations for open source ALM tools used by the Eclipse community and for open ALM standards such as OSLC The project is structured into sub-projects, each representing an ALM category and providing common APIs for specific ALM tools. The primary consumers of this project are ALM ISVs and other adopters of Eclipse ALM frameworks.  Please see the project charter for more details. Mylyn makes tasks a first class part of Eclipse, and integrates rich and offline editing for repositories such as Bugzilla, Trac, and JIRA. Once your tasks are integrated, Mylyn monitors your work activity to identify information relevant to the task-at-hand, and uses this task context to focus the Eclipse UI on the interesting information, hide the uninteresting, and automatically find what's related. This puts the information you need to get work done at your fingertips and improves productivity by reducing searching, scrolling, and navigation. By making task context explicit Mylyn also facilitates multitasking, planning, reusing past efforts, and sharing expertise.\n</code></pre> <p>Example of adding a space:</p> <pre><code>  - oniro:\n      rooms:\n      - alias: '#oniro'\n        type: space\n        name: 'Oniro'\n        topic: |\n          The mission of the Eclipse Oniro is the design, development, production and maintenance of an open source software platform, having an operating system, an ADK/SDK, standard APIs and basic applications, like UI, as core elements, targeting different industries thanks to a next-generation multi-kernel architecture, that simplifies the existing landscape of complex systems, and its deployment across a wide range of devices.\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"chat-service-provisionner/readme/#generate-secrets","title":"Generate secrets","text":"<p>Execute:  <code>secrets/gen-secrets.sh {env}</code> (env = dev/prod/staging)</p> <p>It will store secrets under: <code>/environments/chat-matrix/{env}/.secrets</code></p>"},{"location":"chat-service-provisionner/readme/#install-jsonnet-dependencies","title":"Install jsonnet dependencies","text":"<p>Requires <code>jsonnet-bundler</code> to be installed: https://github.com/jsonnet-bundler/jsonnet-bundler</p> <pre><code>jb install\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"chat-service-provisionner/readme/#deploy-with-apply-script","title":"Deploy with apply script","text":"<pre><code>./apply.sh dev\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"chat-service-provisionner/readme/#deploy-manually","title":"Deploy manually","text":""},{"location":"chat-service-provisionner/readme/#tanka","title":"tanka","text":"<p>see doc installation tanka: <code>https://tanka.dev/install</code></p> <pre><code>tk show \"environments/chat-matrix/dev\"\ntk apply \"environments/chat-matrix/dev\"\n</code></pre> <p>If you want to check the Kubernetes file before applying, try exporting with this command:</p> <pre><code>tk show --dangerous-allow-redirect \"environments/chat-matrix/dev\" &gt; ./k8s/chat-matrix-dev.yaml\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"chat-service-provisionner/readme/#cronjob","title":"Cronjob","text":"<pre><code>JOB_NAME=\"${USERNAME}-manual-run-001\"\nNAMESPACE=\"chat-matrix-prod\"\nkubectl delete job ${JOB_NAME} -n ${NAMESPACE}\nkubectl create job -n ${NAMESPACE} --from=cronjob/chatservice-sync ${JOB_NAME}\n</code></pre> <p>Accept all room invitations and replay the job.

This patent license shall   apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at   the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition   of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the   Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other   combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is   licensed hereunder.</p> <p>c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the   licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are   provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the   patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.   Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims   brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual   property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the   rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby   assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual   property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party   patent license is required to allow Recipient to Distribute the   Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license   before distributing the Program.</p> <p>d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has   sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant   the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.</p> <p>e) Notwithstanding the terms of any Secondary License, no   Contributor makes additional grants to any Recipient (other than   those set forth in this Agreement) as a result of such Recipient's   receipt of the Program under the terms of a Secondary License   (if permitted under the terms of Section 3).</p> <ol> <li>REQUIREMENTS</li> </ol> <p>3.1 If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then:</p> <p>a) the Program must also be made available as Source Code, in   accordance with section 3.2, and the Contributor must accompany   the Program with a statement that the Source Code for the Program   is available under this Agreement, and informs Recipients how to   obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily   used for software exchange; and</p> <p>b) the Contributor may Distribute the Program under a license   different than this Agreement, provided that such license:      i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all other Contributors all      warranties and conditions, express and implied, including      warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and      implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness      for a particular purpose;</p> <pre><code> ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all other Contributors all\n liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,\n incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;\n\n iii) does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights\n in the Source Code under section 3.2; and\n\n iv) requires any subsequent distribution of the Program by any\n party to be under a license that satisfies the requirements\n of this section 3.\n</code></pre> <p>3.2 When the Program is Distributed as Source Code:</p> <p>a) it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the   Program (i) is combined with other material in a separate file or   files made available under a Secondary License, and (ii) the initial   Contributor attached to the Source Code the notice described in   Exhibit A of this Agreement, then the Program may be made available   under the terms of such Secondary Licenses, and</p> <p>b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of   the Program.</p> <p>3.3 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent, trademark, attribution notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations of liability (\"notices\") contained within the Program from any copy of the Program which they Distribute, provided that Contributors may add their own appropriate notices.</p> <ol> <li>COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION</li> </ol> <p>Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor (\"Commercial Contributor\") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor (\"Indemnified Contributor\") against any losses, damages and costs (collectively \"Losses\") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.</p> <p>For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.</p> <ol> <li>NO WARRANTY</li> </ol> <p>EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN \"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.</p> <ol> <li>DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY</li> </ol> <p>EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</p> <ol> <li>GENERAL</li> </ol> <p>If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.</p> <p>If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.</p> <p>All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.</p> <p>Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be Distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was received.

Data from the staging platform will not be migrated.</p> <p>NOTE: This experimentation is currently focused primarily on Gradle/Maven projects.

This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.</p> <p>c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Program.</p> <p>d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.</p> <ol> <li>REQUIREMENTS</li> </ol> <p>A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its own license agreement, provided that:</p> <p>a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and</p> <p>b) its license agreement:</p> <p>i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;</p> <p>ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;</p> <p>iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and</p> <p>iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.</p> <p>When the Program is made available in source code form:</p> <p>a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and</p> <p>b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.</p> <p>Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the Program.</p> <p>Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.</p> <ol> <li>COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION</li> </ol> <p>Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor (\"Commercial Contributor\") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor (\"Indemnified Contributor\") against any losses, damages and costs (collectively \"Losses\") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.</p> <p>For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.</p> <ol> <li>NO WARRANTY</li> </ol> <p>EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN \"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement , including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.</p> <ol> <li>DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY</li> </ol> <p>EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</p> <ol> <li>GENERAL</li> </ol> <p>If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.</p> <p>If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.</p> <p>All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.</p> <p>Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.</p> <p>This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.</p>"},{"location":"signing-services/website/themes/solstice/archetypes/default/","title":"Default","text":"<p>+++ weight = 5 [menu]   [menu.main]     parent = \"x\" +++</p>"},{"location":"best-practices/","title":"Eclipse Common Build Infrastructure Best Practices","text":"<ul> <li>Open Source Software Supply Chain Best Practices at the Eclipse Foundation</li> </ul>"},{"location":"best-practices/CONTRIBUTING/","title":"Contributing to Eclipse Common Build Infrastructure","text":"<p>Thanks for your interest in this project.</p>"},{"location":"best-practices/CONTRIBUTING/#project-description","title":"Project description","text":"<p>The Eclipse Common Build Infrastructure (CBI) combines technologies and practices for building Eclipse Software.</p> <ul> <li>https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/technology.cbi</li> </ul>"},{"location":"best-practices/CONTRIBUTING/#developer-resources","title":"Developer resources","text":"<p>Information regarding source code management, builds, coding standards, and more.</p> <ul> <li>https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/technology.cbi/developer</li> </ul> <p>This project uses GitHub issues on the respective repositories to track ongoing development and issues.</p> <p>Be sure to search for existing bugs before you create another one.

While you're not obligated to use them, please note that Hugo and hugo-eclipsefdn-website-boilerplate are the supported solutions by the Eclipse Foundation. Using a different technology may result in reduced support.</p> <p>We recommend two different solutions to create and manage your static project website. The easiest solution is to keep both the source and distribution files together in one repository. The \"hugo\" command will create all the static files for your website in the \"public\" folder which you need to commit in your repository. To do so, remove \"/public/\" from the .gitignore file. This is included by default because projects often prefer to keep their source code and distribution files in separate repositories and utilize CI to ensure their website is always built with the same version of Hugo. We don't recommend the single Git repo solution if more than one individual is responsible for updating the website. This brings us to our next solution.</p> <p>In the advanced setup, you'll need two Git repositories. The first one will contain your Hugo website's source code, which you can get started by cloning this repo. The second repository stores your Hugo build results (the static HTML that our web server will end up hosting). Once you've completed the initial setup, managing two repos isn't a concern because the second one will be automatically updated via CI.
